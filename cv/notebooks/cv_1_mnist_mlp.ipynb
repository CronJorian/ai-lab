First, we want you to explore the dataset and identify common pitfalls that can occur when working on computer vision tasks. Afterwards, you implement your first neural network, a multilayer perceptron, and train it to be a classifier for the MNIST dataset. Finally, you evaluate your model and take a look on the samples that were misclassified.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Task:**\n","\n","- Please solve all the tasks with code.\n","- You are free to use any python package you like, however, the imports should be enough to solve all the tasks.\n","- Questions (marked with QUESTION tag) requires you to write a short and concise text.\n","\n","**Note:**\n","- Keep in mind that there is not only one solution for each task.\n","- If you need any help use the [Tensorflow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or the [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lBLYFftXkhYc"},"source":["## Prerequisites"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6FmYCbdGOqkf"},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","print(tf.__version__)\n","print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"34TVIcmPQICM"},"source":["# Import MNIST data\n","\n","(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mCPpOg_1r3Rr"},"source":["## Getting an intuition about the MNIST data and make it ready for the learning task\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ig0jsuBE2BtY"},"source":["Have a look at the dataset (train/test) and find out ...\n","- ... how many samples there are\n","- ... what shape and dtype the images/labels have\n","- ... what (unique) labels there are\n","\n","Can you spot an issue with the data?
