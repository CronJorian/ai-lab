# Module: Computer Vision

This folder contains the exercisec of the Coputer Vision module. The exercises are structured as follows.

## Exercise 1: MNIST with MLP

This exercise is meant to provide you an introduction to using tensorflow. Please follow the instructions in the notebook `cv_1_mnist_mlp.ipynb`.

## Exercise 2: MNIST with CNN

This exercise is meant to provide you an introduction to using convolutional layers tensorflow. Please follow the instructions in the notebook `cv_2_mnist_cnn.ipynb`.

## Exercise 3: CIFAR10 and overfitting

This exercise gives you insight into the concrete methods for preventing overfitting in deep learning for image classification. It will teach you how to use early stopping, dropout, batch normalization and data augmentation with CIFAR10. Please follow the instructions in the notebook `cv_3_cifar10.ipynb`.
